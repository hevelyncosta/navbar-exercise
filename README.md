# ✏️ NavBar Exercise

In this small React project, guided by instructor John Smilga (Udemy), I revisited some key approaches to toggling menus.

#### Revisited Topics

- React-icons

  - Icons from react-icons can be used directly in the data structures. In data.jsx file, I have two arrays.

- Toggle Approach

  - State value (boolean)
  - Render links in the Navbar based on the state value
  - Set up a button that toggles the value

- Dynamic Approach
  - Here, I've used the _useRef_ hook and the _getBoundingClientRect()_ function from Vanilla JS, to get the height of the links.
